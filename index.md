# CUE: THE EXCLUSIVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR CADILLAC

## ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE CADILLAC USER EXPERIENCE (CUE)

Cadillac is GM’s (General Motors) prestige sport-luxury vehicle brand sold in North America, China, Korea, Europe, and the Middle East. Their bold, daring, and original lineup seamlessly blends driving dynamics, refinement, and technology to satisfy both luxury seekers and performance driving enthusiasts. If you’ve never been inside a Cadillac lately, what you’ll realize when sitting inside one is that you are truly in the cockpit of a luxury car with technology that is on top of its game.

Such fantastic feeling is stirred mostly by the impressive and innovative infotainment system known as CUE, which stands for Cadillac User Experience. The first thing that you’ll probably notice is its gorgeous, all-black iPad-looking 8” touchscreen that instantly comes alive at the push of the start button, and if your model has the all-digital instrument panel, then watching the whole thing come alive is like nothing you’ve seen before.

CADILLAC CUE KEY SYSTEM FEATURES
CUE is an intuitive infotainment, communication, and navigation system that was first made available with the [2013 Cadillac XTS](https://www.gm-navigation.com/shop/2013-2015-cadillac-cue-factory-navigation-system/), taking the automotive market by storm. Its primary element is the 8-inch LCD multi-touch haptic screen, where you can swipe, pinch, spread, and tap, just as you would on a smartphone or tablet.

True Customization. Once the display is on, you’ll be shown a beautiful, clean interface with icons to control everything in the car (HVAC, sound, paired phones, etc.), so you can actually [personalize](http://www.cadillac.com/cadillac-cue/using-cue.html) almost every aspect of your vehicle.

The Proximity-sensing technology detects your hand as it approaches the touchscreen, and when an icon is pressed, the screen pulses to acknowledge the command so you can keep your eyes safely on the road instead of checking whether or not you selected the right option.

Natural Voice Recognition lets you place phone calls, play music, and locate destinations effortlessly.
